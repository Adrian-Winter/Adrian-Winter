# Hello there! 👋

##  🎢 About Me 

I am Adrian, __currently__ studying the M.Sc Mechatronics at the TUHH and working on the HyPLANT100 project as a student assistant. 🔭

__In the past__ I worked on projects such as creating augmented reality applications for industrial additive manufacturing, designing hydrogen powered drones and implementing a proximity formation flight system. 

__In the future__ I would love to work on renewable energies🌞, sustainable aviation✈️ and be part of cradle-2-cradle🔄  and automation projects⚙️.

🌱 My philosophy is to never stop learning, automate anything that isn't fun, and embrace change.

## 🤔 Why am I on Github?

I am on Github to make my private projects that I ve worked accessable to the community. The Idea is that nobody who wants to create somthing similar 
to what I made needs to start from zero but can rather use whatever usefull bits or full scrips from my repos. I really like the open soure spirit and I have learned a lot form resources people shared freely. This is my way of contributing and giving back to the community. Many projects I uploaded here were just lying around on my local drive, because I couldn't find the time or motivation to polish them to a state where I could upload them with a good conscience. If there can be found here now: Hooray! They made it! 🎉

## 📈 What topics to exepect in the future

My areas of interests are: 

- ✈️ Sustainable Aviation
- ⚙️ Automation 
- 💨 Aerodynamics & Wind Turbines 
- 🌞 Solar Energy 
- 🎹 Music 


so exepect anything realeated to these areas! My preferred programming Languages are Python, C# and M4L😊.
Also don't expect to see a new project every week or tons of contributions to other projects as I am quite busy (at least for now) with my current job and sideprojects. And with that I welcome you to my GIT!😄
